# Vinbero
Vinbero is a very fast high-performance SRv6 implementation.

The [previous implementation](
https://github.com/takehaya/Vinbero-legacy/tree/master) has become outdated, so we decided to reimplement it with a new codebase.

## Build
TBA

## Run

## Trivia
The Vinbero is an Esperanto word meaning `grape`
A meshed node running SRv6 looks like a grape when viewed from above:)
