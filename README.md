# Vinbero
Vinbero is a very fast high-performance SRv6 implementation.

</div>

The [previous implementation](
https://github.com/takehaya/Vinbero-legacy/tree/master) has become outdated, so we decided to reimplement it with a new codebase.

## Build
```shell
make bpf-gen
make build
```

## Run
TBA

## Trivia
The Vinbero is an Esperanto word meaning `grape`
A meshed node running SRv6 looks like a grape when viewed from above:)
